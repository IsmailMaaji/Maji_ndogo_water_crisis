Access to water is a fundamental human right, yet in a fictional country*, many citizens struggle to access clean water at levels far below international standards. By analyzing data on water sources, collection processes, and related crime, we can gain valuable insights into the daily challenges faced by the population and the critical importance of water in their lives.

<h3>Project 1: Analyzing Survey Data</h3>

- Reviewed 60,000 records collected by surveyors and engineers to extract meaningful insights.
- Identified and categorized different water sources across the country.
- Examined visiting patterns of surveyors to understand coverage and frequency.
- Documented pollution issues affecting water sources, highlighting areas of concern.

<h3>Project 2: Data Cleanup and Analysis</h3>

  - Conducted extensive data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency.
  - Broke down the scope of the water crisis, defining key areas of focus.
  - Developed hypotheses to guide further investigation and analysis.
  - Analyzed water collection queues to understand the burden on citizens and identify inefficiencies.

<h3>Project 3: Database Structuring and Relationship Analysis</h3>

  - Designed an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to map out the relationships between various data tables.
  - Performed table joins to identify and eliminate duplicate records.
  - Linked tables to uncover discrepancies, including frequent visits to certain locations and reports of potential fraud.

<h3>Project 4: Fraud Detection and Solution Development</h3>

  - Identified and eliminated fraudulent cases from the dataset.
  - Developed practical solutions to address the water crisis, based on data-driven insights.
  - Created a table for engineers to update, tracking work completed on specific projects to ensure ongoing accountability.
Once the data querying process was completed, the dataset was transferred to Power BI for comprehensive visualization, providing a clear and actionable overview of the water crisis.
